# Module 15 Challenge: NY Citibike with Tableau

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, we are adding a bike trip analysis to our presentation to investors.  Using a NY Citibike dataset we will create a set of visualizations to:
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Finally, we will add these new visualizations to several prior for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.
    
    
## Results: 
    Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.
    - There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis (7 pt)
    - There is a description of the results for each visualization (7 pt)
